Tuesday:
	
	Got everything I wanted to do done. At the end of the day I was however left with a rather odd memory leak which I was having a hard time getting rid of, it turned out to just be a very silly little issue concerning list deallocation. But, as I said, everything else went well and I got everything I said I wanted to get done done.
